##HW-1 Post Write Up
I had to get an extension for this assignment due to an illness. My work flow
consisted of building a skeleton and then expanding upon each area thereafter.
I ran into issues from the start but most of them were quickly fixable. One area
that I had to let go was the in-page navigation. When I was attempting to wrap
the div around the entirety of the class it broke how my parallax worked because
text would still scroll but the background image was completely hidden. The
navigation did not quite work either. The buttons were there but they weren't
moving to the other divs. I do have a link to an outside source, just not within
the page. I think that is the only thing missing so I am calling this assignment
good enough for now. Below is a link to the live site.
