##HW-3 Overview
#Along-side the video tutorials.
I checked their accuracy via pushing
to GitHub and then viewing the live site. I noticed that because we are using an
html file without the index prefix that the live site goes to the readme.md page
instead. The full path needs to include the ValueDataType.html tag in order
 for the correct webpage to be displayed. I also learned that tabbing helps if I
 misspell words in the heat of the moment, but makes more to fix in the long run
 if I used the variable more than once. Also, case matters.

#Homework assignment issues and how I managed them:
USING AN IMAGE WITH DOCUMENT.WRITE:
 I could not add an image as the background because it covers the DOM.
 Attempting to use the hero-image format from HW-1 does the same, but looks better in
 comparison to using a full-screen background. At first, I couldn't  get the hero-image
to show up because I forgot to keep the entirety of the style.css file that I imported
from HW-1 and thus forgot to add the first three lines of code which included the
body and html. Then after I got it to work, that's when I lost my document.write
because I imagine that it's hidden by this background image. Resizing the body/html
in style.css to 50% from 100% didn't work. Moving the background position to the
bottom didn't work.
