##HW-3 Overview
#For this weeks assignment:

 I followed along-side the video tutorials. I checked their accuracy via pushing
to GitHub and then viewing the live site. I noticed that because we are using an
html file without the index prefix that the live site goes to the readme.md page
instead. The full path needs to include the ValueDataType.html tag in order
 for the correct webpage to be displayed. I also learned that tabbing helps if I
 misspell words in the heat of the moment, but makes more to fix in the long run
 if I used the variable more than once. One of my initial variables was titled
 'favotire' instead of favorite, and so I had several mentions of my
 'favotireNumber' in my code. Good times.
