#Work Flow

#Issues:

#1
Right off of the bat my naming conventions were
too loose and I couldn't get my first class and
function to work because of it until after several
reviews.

#2
I cannot get my images to work. I've looked at other
repositories and I just don't get what I  am doing
wrong! Everything else works, everything.
