## HW-7

#Work Flow

I gave myself an 8 hour window to complete this assignment
and would have finished with an hour to spare but fought with
myself far into the night. (I'm pretty sure I won.)

#Issues:

#1 My bad.
When following the example tutorial, I used the same
name for more than one thing and realized that 'theTitle'
and 'title' were given separate names for a reason.  

#2 I almost broke out the pin doll.
I spent over 2 hours trying to figure out how to get the
images to appear. I finally realized that in my index.html
file I was using a <div id = "image"> instead of
<img id = "image"> to summon the image.
