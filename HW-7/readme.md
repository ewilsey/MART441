## HW-7

#Work Flow

I gave myself 8 hours to do this assignment and it took me
a little over 10 hours in total.

#Issues:

#1
When following the example tutorial, I used the same
name for more than one thing and realized that theTitle
and title were separate for a reason.  

#2
I spent over 2 hours trying to figure out how to get the
images to appear. I finally realized that in the index.html
file I was using a div id instead of an img id for the image.
(I almost broke out the pin doll on that one.)
