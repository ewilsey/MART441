#Work Flow
-I created an HTML page w/ folders and pages.
-I made an H1 tag for "Hello World" and changed the tag style in css.
-I drew a series of monsters and two buttons and added them to the images folder.
-I styled the HTML page in css so that the images would appear center, the H1 tag
would float above center, and the buttons would float on top of the image with a
margin on either side.  
-I used jquery to give the buttons functionality by changing the active status of
the images when the buttons were clicked.
-I used jquery to loop the button function so that the end img would cycle to the first
img and vice versa.

#Take Away
I originally wanted the animation to happen automatically; as of now, the animation
is semi-automatic.

#Potential Changes
In the future I would like the images to change automatically with one-press of
a button or have the animation begin on load.
