I think that I was fairly successful with this assignment. I wanted the eyes to change color and back but I
was having trouble figuring that out. I also thought about putting in random
colors but after looking online it seemed like a bigger task than I was willing to
tackle at this time. When I tried to change the .css between white and red, it changed once
and ignored the others, but would hide and show multiple times just fine.
