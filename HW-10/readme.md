##HW 10

#Late on this assignment.
For the 3rd or more week in a row, I had issues from the start. The script will work on the
course website but not on my end when I put it in its own folder. I cannot get the blue square to
show up. The tutorials changed so there is less information to go off of. I want to see a working
example and then I want to try it on my own. Building the entire week off of me not getting
the tutorial to work on my end was very frustrating.

## The tutorials never show enough information.
If I could get 2 steps into a task and then have a find out on my own portion it would be
better than this here's 1 step or here's no steps: good luck. That's what makes this class
needlessly difficult. I want to showcase my talents and not spend hours trying to
figure out why 1 insignificant thing isn't working. Even on week 9, getting AJAX, jquery and
JSON to work together was a nightmare. I even tried to stop by and get help and was told to chain
it and that didn't help.

#Why do I have to spend so much time researching outside sources?
I don't get it.
