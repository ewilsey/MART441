##HW 10

#Late on this assignment.
For several weeks in a row, I have had issues from the start of the tutorials. They
are becoming more and more vague and IT IS NOT HELPING!!! I have not been completing assignments
to my standards because I don't know how to get anything done or even started.

## THE TUTORIALS NEED TO SHOW MORE INFORMATION!!!
A detailed walkthrough of a task BEFORE having to find out how to do the rest on my own is
all that I ask for. I want to showcase my talents and not spend hours
trying to figure out why 1 insignificant thing isn't working.

## Not the first time this has happened.
Last week was a nightmare (week 9) and getting AJAX, jquery and JSON to work together was too
confusing. I even drove to Missoula to stop in and get help and was told to chain
jquery and that didn't help.

#Why do I have to spend so much time researching outside sources?
I watch several tutorials on YouTube and read through examples on W3 Schools.
It would be preferable to get the majority if not ALL of the information from the class tutorials.
