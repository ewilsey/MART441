##HW 10

#Late on this assignment.
For several weeks in a row, I have had issues from the moment the tutorial starts. They
are becoming more and more vague and IT IS NOT HELPING!!! I have not been completing assignments
to my standards because I don't know how to get anything done or even started. It's ruining
coding for me. This week was by far the worst.

## THE TUTORIALS NEED TO SHOW MORE INFORMATION!!!
A detailed walkthrough of a task BEFORE having to find out how to do the rest on my own is
all that I ask for. I want to showcase my talents and not spend hours
trying to figure out why 1 insignificant thing isn't working.

#I am spending too much time researching outside sources.
I'm in class when the tutorials are streamed or there wouldn't be 30 seconds of silence at
the end of every example video. I always have questions that aren't getting asked.
I watch several outside tutorials on YouTube regularly; W3 schools and it is just all too vague.
It would be preferable to get the majority if not ALL of the information from the class tutorials
with fully functioning examples: a walk through with a hands-on portion that is walked-though!
