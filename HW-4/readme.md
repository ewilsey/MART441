##HW-4 Overview
#My process:
I created all of my folders and files first, then I linked my script.js and
style.css to my index.html file.  

#Issues:

#1 Style-Color:
I wanted to have a background color with a similar gradient effect to the hero-
image. The linear-gradient function removed the background color and text color.
I settled for a change in background color opacity. %88 allows for the lighter
text to pop from the darker background color.

#2 Style-font:
I found a built-in font called 'fantasy'. Stylistically it works for headers but
not for paragraphs. I went with 'serif' for the body text. Changes to body
included increased font-size, borders, boroder style, and color matching. Line-
height was also adjusted.
