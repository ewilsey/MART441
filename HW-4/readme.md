##HW-4 Overview
#My process:
I created all of my folders and files first, then I linked my script.js and
style.css to my index.html file.  Index was created, organized and attacked
first, then style, and then script. This readme.md was created, updated, and
replaced frequently throughout the process.

#Issues and Anecdotes:

#1 The background:
I originally wanted a gradient grey over a background blue to make the text pop.
What I ended up doing is going back to my web-dev repo and studying the .css
files so that I could relearn how to structure my code better. My new background
is a series of boxes arranged so that changing elements will be cleaner and
should attract the eye to those areas. Also, I finally got a background-color to
work behind an image.

#2 The Style:
I wanted the style to be memorable for this piece. I was able to find a built in
font-family or two. I adjusted everything I could find without breaking the code.

The hardest part of this and the last assignment was getting the image to function
in the way I desired as stated above. I got something to almost work but I wanted
to rearrange my structure and broke it. I reverted back several steps to where it
was close, and from there it was a quick fix to achieve my goal.

#3 Script:
I was able to fix every issue in my script except for one: after the first button
click the button and input area jump to the left hand side of the container. It
functions, but I don't like that it moves.

I had an issue getting functions to work and peeking at Jack Lawless's script
section of his index file in the repository helped me find where I was going
wrong. I needed to update the variable's name for every choice to coincide with
that choice.

I misplaced a bracket at the very end of my work cycle but was able to catch it
upon inspecting my commit history via GitHub. S
