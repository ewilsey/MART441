##HW-4 Overview
#My process:
I created all of my folders and files first, then I linked my js and css to my
html file.  

#1
I wanted to have a background color and I achieved that, but I also wanted a
similar gradient effect to the hero-image. When I added the linear-gradient
function, the background and text colors were removed and defaulted to black and
white. I removed the function and then changed the opacity of the background to
%88 allowing for the lighter text to pop from the much darker background color.

#2
I wanted to style the font and so I googled and looked at examples and tested
a built in font called 'fantasy'. Stylistically it works for headers but not for
 paragraphs. So I went with 'serif' for the body text. I centered the body,
 increased font-size. Created a border around h1 and colored it. 

#3
I watched the example tutorial once all the way through before attempting to
work alongside it.
