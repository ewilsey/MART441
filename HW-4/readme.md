##HW-4 Overview
#My process:
I created all of my folders and files first, then I linked my script.js and
style.css to my index.html file.  Index was created, organized and attacked
first, then style, and then script. This readme.md was created, updated, and
replaced frequently throughout the process.

#Issues and Anecdotes:

#1 The background:
I originally wanted a gradient grey over a background blue to make the text pop.
What I ended up doing is going back to my web-dev repo and studying the .css
files so that I could relearn how to structure my code better. My new background
is a series of boxes arranged so that changing elements will be cleaner and
should attract the eye to those areas. Also, I finally got a background-color to
work behind an image.

#2 The Style:
I wanted the style to be memorable for this piece. I was able to find a built in
font-family or two. I adjusted everything I could find without breaking the code.
The hardest part of this and the last assignment was getting the image to function
in the way I desired as stated above. I got something to almost work but I wanted
to rearrange my structure and broke it. I reverted back several steps to where it
was close, and from there it was a quick fix to achieve my goal.

#3 Script:
My userChoice segment is mostly non-case sensitive. 'Go' and 'go' will return
Proposal2, 'Stay' or 'stay' will return Proposal1. Any other answer will return:
'Invalid Response'.
