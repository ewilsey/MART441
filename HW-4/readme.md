##HW-4 Overview
#My process:
I created all of my folders and files first, then I linked my js and css to my
html file.  

#1 Style-Color
I wanted to have a background color with a similar gradient effect to the hero-
image. The linear-gradient function removed the background color and text color.
I settled for a change in background color opacity. %88 allows for the lighter
text to pop from the darker background color.

#2 Style-font
I found a built in font called 'fantasy'. Stylistically it works for headers but
not for paragraphs. So I went with 'serif' for the body text. I centered the
body, increased font-size, and created a border around h1 with matching color.
Line-height did not feel quite right; adjusting it became a task.
