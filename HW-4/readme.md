##HW-4 Overview
#My process:
I created all of my folders and files first, then I linked my script.js and
style.css to my index.html file.  Index was created, organized and attacked
first, then style, and then script.

#Issues:

#1 The background:
I originally wanted a gradient grey over a background blue to make the text pop.
What I ended up doing is going back to my web-dev repo and studying the .css
files so that I could relearn how to structure my code better. My new background
is a series of box arranged so that elements that change will be cleaner and
should attract the eye to those areas.

#2 The Style:
I wanted the style to be memorable for this piece. I was able to find built in
font-family or two. I adjusted everything I could find without breaking the code.
The hardest part of this and the last assignment was getting the image to function
in the way I desired. I got something to almost work but I wanted to rearrange
my structure and broke it. I reverted back several steps to where it was close,
and from there it was a quick fix to get what I wanted.
