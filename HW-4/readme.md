##HW-4 Overview

#My process:
I created all of my folders and files first, then I linked my script.js and
style.css to my index.html file.  Index was created, organized and attacked
first, then style, and then script. This readme.md was created, updated, and
replaced frequently throughout.

#Issues and Anecdotes:

#1 The background:
I had issues with the background all throughout my coding process until I
re-discovered containers and benefits of divs thanks to older repositories and
experimentation.

#2 The Style:
I wanted the style to showcase my understanding of the project. I adjusted
everything I could find without breaking the code(I broke the code many
  times).

The hardest part of styling this assignment was getting the picture on top of
the background but having both as backgrounds.

Another hard part was getting my containers to stay put and for their contents to
act how I wanted them. I still haven't fixed the moving input and button.

#3 Script:
I was able to fix every issue in my script except for one: after the first button
click the button and input area jump to the left hand side of the container. It
functions, but it's not supposed to move.

I want to credit Jack Lawless because I found his script on the repository and
it helped me figure out why my functions weren't advancing after the second choice.
Our naming conventions happened to be similar so discovering the problem was as
simple as much as it was a life-saver.

I must also give credit to the history function on the GitHub desktop app. At the
very end of coding process I misplaced but was able to find a bracket that broke
my code and rendered the buttons useless.

#The Takeaway:
If someone were to get an invalid answer, they are required to remember the
question they were just asked; the question is not repeated for invalid
inputs. This does not break the code but may be considered an unwanted feature.

I'm still bothered by the moving input and button.

I could have added changing pictures and I might still; I am dreading the possible
bugs that may occur. Because this assignment was so complicated, there were a lot
of bugs!
