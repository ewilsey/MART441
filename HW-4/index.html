    <h1>Tubersome Grin</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>As a self-aware potato, your only mission is to survive.
    <br>
    Simple? Many obstacles stand in your path.
    <br>
    Many foes stand to gain noteriety from your defeat.
    <br>
    Will you become the baked potato you were once destined to become?
    <br>
    Or will you rise above and transform into something much greater?
    <br>
    The choice is yours, but yours alone. What will you do?</p>
