          As a self-aware potato, your only mission is to survive.

          Simple? Many obstacles stand in your path.

          Many foes stand to gain noteriety from your defeat.

          Will you become the baked potato you were once destined to become?

          Or will you rise above and transform into something much greater?

          The choice is yours, but yours alone. What will you do?
