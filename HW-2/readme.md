##HW-2 Overview
#For this weeks assignment:
 I followed along with the console command tutorials on the course website.
Then I attempted to make my own on Atom. When I tested my console log on my live
site, I noticed that my color wasn't working because I forgot to add the hyphen
between background and color. That fixed that issue. Now that my test console log
and color are working; I added the 3 console logs necessary to answer the
questions from the HW-2 assignment page. The last thing I did was attach a
background-image to my index file. It took a while to figure out the proper syntax
to get the code to work. I had even looked at another student's code but they did
something I had never seen before and attached the background image to the body
tag itself. I decided to add it to the style portion in the head as we did in HW-1
instead.
