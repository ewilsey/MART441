Starting the assignment was difficult due to poor time management on my part.

Two areas gave me major issues:
1. I was having naming convention issues inside of my JSON and it took me forever to get off
the ground running.
2. When trying to duplicate the AJAX.js file to the identical jsonAjax.js file,
it would not load. I could not figure out what went wrong so I kept AJAX.js, deleted
jsonAjax and proceeded from there without issue.

I watched the tutorial videos and one other one I found on YouTube about
using JSON and AJAX and it helped me realize that I could create as many JSON files as I wanted so I
created 31. I created a JSON counter to change JSON files numerically via the button press.
On my own I discovered that I could endlessly loop the 31 JSON files by resetting the JSON
counter back to 1 after the 31st button click. The tutorial I watched hid the button
after the final click because without my solution,  further clicks would attempt
to summon non-existent JSON files.
