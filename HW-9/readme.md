# Starting Issues
I took too much time off from finishing the last HW-8 assignment to starting this
one. One of the errors I find myself tripping into is my naming conventions. It's
so hard to spot when everything seems to be working and I can't find my normal errors of
missing brackets or colons. I had to restart the assignment several times and even tried other
tutorials, but nothing was working. Finally when my JSON was working properly, I was
able to proceed.
