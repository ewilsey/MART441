#Work Flow
I followed along the example, updated where I needed to, and checked my work
against other students' repositories as I went.

As usual, I checked my own work via the live site. Ensuring I have the proper
naming conventions for my files and folders is important from step one. I know
that if my live site goes to the readme.md, that I forgot to name my first page
index.html.

When I got to the end of the example tutorial, I looked at what other students
were doing with their codes to see how they were getting their results. I wanted
to have my page automatically change after the game was over but I couldn't
figure it out. I noticed that someone else added a button to the bottom of the
game and so I adopted their technique for finishing out the game.
