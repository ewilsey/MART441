#Work Flow

I followed along with the example, updated where I needed to, and checked my work
against other students' repositories as I went.

As usual, I tested my work via the live site. I had very minor issues this go
around and was able to get a working version of the game up rather quickly.

I had to look at what other students were doing with their codes to see how they
were getting their end page. As a result, I found a another student who used a
button to trigger the stats page for when the player is ready to end the game.

#Concerns

I like the end game button, but I think completing all possible matches should
trigger the final page too. 

#Potential future improvements

I'd like the last match of the game to trigger the final page change.
A leaderboard page would be cool too.
