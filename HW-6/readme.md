#Work Flow

I followed along the example, updated where I needed to, and checked my work
against other students' repositories as I went.

As usual, I tested my own work via the live site. I had very minor issues this go
around and was able to get a working version of the game up rather quickly.

I had to look at what other students were doing with their codes to see how they
were getting their results. I wanted to have my page automatically change to the
final page after the game was over but I couldn't figure it out.
I noticed that someone else added a button at the bottom of their game and so I
adopted their technique for ending the game and forcing the final stats page.

#Potential future improvements

I'd like the last match of the game to trigger the page change, and I'd like to be able to
restart back to the player information page and/or to the game page from the
stats page. A leaderboard page would be cool too.
