## HW-6

#Work Flow
I followed along the example, updated where I needed to, and checked my work
against students' repositories as I went.

As usual, I checked my own work via the live site. Ensuring I have the proper
naming conventions for my files and folders is important from step one. I know
that if my live site goes to the readme.md, that I forgot to name my first page
index.html.
