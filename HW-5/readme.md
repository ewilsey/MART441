##HW-5 Overview

stick as closely to the example as possible.


#Issue 1: image two
After following the example, my imgs/two.jpg was not working on my live site. I
fixed it the first time not remembering what I did. Tried to expand to 10 images
and broke the site entirely after updating the readme. I undid my changes back to
where I broke the code the first time and discovered a syntax error with jpeg not
jpg.

#Issue 2:



#Live Site:
