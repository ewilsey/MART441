##HW-5 Overview
For this week's HW-5 assignment, I copied the example and worked
from there. Normally I start from scratch but I decided to
stick as closely to the example as possible.


#Issue 1
At first my imgs/two.jpg image wasn't working on my live site
even though I copied the code near exactly to the example. I am
not sure what I did to fix it but it started working after a
little fiddling.

#Issue 2
I updated the index and script to reflect the changes for up to
10 cards, 2 sets of 5 images. I labelled my images one, two...
and so on. When I first examined my changes, the images three-
five were not displaying and instead of saying the image names
as it had done on the previous issue, the image file was
labelled undefined. I changed line 30 of my script:
while image length from <4 to <10. Maybe thinking that
was the issue. Then the page stopped loading entirely. Nothing changed except for
changing that parameter and adding a readme and now the site stopped working.
