##HW-5 Overview
For this week's HW-5 assignment, I copied the example and worked
from there. Normally I start from scratch but I decided to
stick as closely to the example as possible.


#Issue 1: image two
After following the example, my imgs/two.jpg was not working on my live site. I
fixed it the first time not remembering what I did. Tried to expand to 10 images
and broke the site entirely after updating the readme. I undid my changes back to
where I broke the code the first time and discovered a syntax error with jpeg not
jpg.

#Issue 2 more image related issues:
When I updated the index and script to reflect the new images, the images were
not showing at first. I changed length to 10 and random number counter to 5, images
reappeared. But now only 2 images were being called up. I changed var count from
2 0's to 5 0's.

#Takeaway:
Because I followed the example and did not start from scratch, completing the
assigned task was not difficult at all. I had only minor issues and they were
 easy to fix. I was worried that not starting from scratch would make
it harder to identify the issues and it kind of did, but once I studied the
code I was able to fix it in no time. At this point I have not changed the
style at all, all I really did was add my own images and updated the index and
script.
